  <h3>Professional Summary:</h3>


<p>I am a graduate of the University of Miami, where I obtained my Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering. Following my bachelors, I obtained my Masters in Business with emphasis in Global Technology Management. I have worked with large-scale corporations, such as Ivax Pharmaceuticals, as well as medical diagnostic start-ups and have  helped grown the companies from zero-dollars in revenue to being profitable. My professional background consist of positions such as an analytical chemist, sales representative, sales and marketing director and chief operating officer. I have nearly 15 years of business experience in the anti-aging, nutrition and integrative medical industry, where I collaborate with physicians, and health and wellness centers. As the CEO and co-founder for HealthSnap Solutions, I aim to change the standard in healthcare where prevention is prioritized over treatment</p>
